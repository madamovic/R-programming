This is an R markdown document for testing.Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring webpages...

Use an asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as *italics* or **bold**.

Create lists with a dash, like this:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
- etc.

```
Use back ticks to 
create a block of code
```

You can even embed LaTeX equations:
$\frac{2}{\pi}\sum^{n}_{i=1}x^{i}$

You can also add footnotes, citations, and a bibliography. [^1]
